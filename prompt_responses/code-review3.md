**Response**:
There are a few errors and strange behaviors in this code:

1. The opening brace { after the first {extends file='page.tpl'} does not have a corresponding closing brace }.
2. There are multiple instances of {extends file='page.tpl'} without any corresponding blocks to override the parent template.
3. The comment <!-- Content moved to /modules/dpjemployee/views/templates/hook/contactus.tps --> is not properly closed with a closing comment tag -->.

These issues suggest that the code may not function as intended and could cause errors or unexpected behavior.
