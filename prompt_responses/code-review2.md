**Response**:
From a reading, there are three potential issues in this piece of code:

1. **Nested Blocks**: The blocks are nested in a way that might not be best suited for your needs. The block 'hook_home' is placed inside 'page_content' which has already been defined above. If you want both the blocks to be present, then they have to be separated and not nested. 

2. **Multiple Extensions**: The extension `{extends file='page.tpl'}` appears more than once in the code. Typically, in a Smarty Template, the `{extends}` function is used only once to define which base Smarty file we are using for a template. This can create confusion and result in an error.

3. **Empty Blocks**: There are empty blocks in the code. It's not clear whether they're leftover rubbish or placeholders for something yet to be added. If they are not meant to be there they should be removed, otherwise, they could cause confusion and potential bugs in the future.

Please refer back to the PrestaShop Smarty Template documentation for more information and to correct the issues.
